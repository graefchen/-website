      <h1>Here are the best photos of my two cats</h1>
      <p>
        They are called <em>Ticky</em> and <em>Tine</em> and both were adopted
        from a local shelter, that took them apparently from the streets of
        Romania.

        <h2>Ticky</h2>
        <p>
          Ticky has a white fur colour with black spots. She is the older of my
          cats and she is a very demanding but also cuddly cat at that. Her tail
          has been amputated, probably because of an accident she had.

      <section id="tine">
        <h2>Tine</h2>
        <p>
          Tine has a tortoiseshell fur and is the way more active compared to
          Ticky. She likes to jump up high places and sometimes this place can
          be also be your back or your shoulders.
