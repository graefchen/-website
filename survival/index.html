          Somehow I am currently very invested in various video games or mods
          with a very survival orinted gameplay.

        <h2>Fallout 4</h2>
        <p>
          Since playing Fallout 4 on the Survival Difficulty, I must say, that
          this is for me personally the only way to play Fallout 4 anymore. It
          is way different than the normal difficulties and makes the gameplay
          and how you plan to play very different and in my opinion far better.
        </p>
        <p>
          It restictes you to not fast travel and stock and plan, especially
          because you can not just save while playing but you need to save while
          sleeping. The game stops being the arcade-like game it is and becomes
          way more tactical and harder in a way I really prefer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also think it is very interesting that the settlment system more or
          less accidentally can make the game fairly easy and creates a system
          in which you see them as simple smaller bases from which you can and
          should branch of to near dungeons and help explore the world even
          further.

        <h2>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h2>
        <p>
          While the Survival Mode in Skyrim was not added later into the Game,
          it is a Mod in the Shop and it was given away for free during the
          Anniversary update for Skyrim Special Edition.<br />
          And I just played roughly 2 hours of it at the time of jotting this
          down, but I think I can already say that, while I am also playing it
          on the "Adept" difficulty, it is already fairly refreshing to play
          with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gameplay feels different, you are restricted by warmth and need to
          manage your food intake, but also the halved carry weight make it
          already a very different experience. Additionally you also arent able
          to fast travel, and while I did a little bit of a playthrough where I
          tried to not fast travel, I have way more experince with it in
          <a href="#fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> and it feels way better being
          restricted by the game than by yourself to follow a certain rule. It
          makes also the exploring and the traveling way more intersting,
          especially as Bethesda has already put much work into Random
          Encounters and Random interactions with the Game World.

        <h2>The Long Dark</h2>
        <p>
          The Long Dark is, compared with the other games on this list here,
          probably the hardest survival games I have played. Even as I did try
          it on the lowest difficulty, it was still unforgiving, it wasn't an
          easy walk, it didn't care about me, it was hard.
