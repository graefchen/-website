only the [html|css|js] files are uploaded
over sftp to the tilde.town server

this does not include feels, the blogging
software installed by default on the tilde
server

i am currently wanting to add a lot more to
this website, as mentioned in the index.html

including a lot of work that has to do with
microformats[1] and cleare semantic html
including the #wants section on the homepage,
where i want to add a lot more elements and
